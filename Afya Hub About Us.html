        Summary
        <br></br>
Sell testing services to hospitals.
<br></br>
 Hospitals are congested, and long queues are discouraging for patients. Remote testing centres within localities allow registration and testing of vitals before patients get to the hospital. They also allow taking of tests prescribed by the doctor. Removing these services from the single hospital premises and redistributing them to several testing centres within the county reduces waiting time within the hospital by about two and a half hours. This also ensures that visiting the hospital will solely be for consultation and nothing else. The fee paid by the hospitals will cater to the convenience offered, and will also give them access to all remote testing centres under our company. In essence, they won’t have one lab, but several in every locality. Majority of the fee paid will be channelled to the owners of the testing centres, and majority, if not all, of the money paid for tests will be channelled to the hospital. They will therefore get the same profit from consultation and testing as they did before. All parties will be satisfied. This will pave way for full implementation of our system, once the testing centres are up and running.
<br></br>
Concept
<br></br>
The core component of our project is remote testing. While other telemedicine products have been introduced to the market, none of them address this loophole, which is essential in the delivery of quality health care. As such, this is the component we ought to put most focus on to get a hold of the market. On this front, we have several alternatives ranging from:
Collaborating with already-existing large-scale pharmacies such as goodlife, which already provide lab testing services.
Seek investment into setting up our own testing centres at strategic locations based on data on distribution of patients.
Collaborate with small scale pharmacists or chemists to set up testing centres under our name.
Collaborate with hospitals to set up testing centres across the country.
The first three are the most viable as they create a dependency on our system to achieve remote testing. While the fourth would be the most plausible, owing to the financial capability of hospitals to set up such testing centres, it eliminates any benefit we might bring to hospitals. With proper investment, the second option would be the best as it gives us full control of the testing process. 
<br></br>

First phase (Remote testing centres)
<br></br>
While the system will already be in place at the onset of this stage, its capabilities will be limited to communication between testing centres and hospitals. The remote testing centres will be our main selling point. On assumption of proper investment into the business, we will set up testing centres at strategic areas based on data from hospitals. These testing centres, initially at least, will have sufficient equipment to carry out blood tests, stool tests, urine tests, and swab tests. On their completion, we will market the said testing centres to hospitals as a way of decongesting their hospitals with minimal loss. The testing centres will achieve decongestion by ensuring patients only visit hospitals for the sole purpose of seeing a doctor and consulting. To give a better picture, say, Nairobi West Hospital’s patients are mostly in South C, Pangani, Athi river, and Kibera. Our testing centres will be set up in these areas among others for wider reach. Patients will be able to walk into the testing centres which would be right within their estates, register (information will be sent to the hospital) and get their vitals checked before going to Nairobi West Hospital to ONLY see a doctor. There will be no queuing for registration, taking of vitals by the nurse, or for lab tests. Assuming each doctor’s appointment takes a maximum of five minutes, the average waiting time to see a doctor once at the hospital will be approximately 30 minutes. This, originally, would amount to three hours or more if the afore-mentioned processes would still be carried out in the hospitals. Another step we hope to eliminate will be the unnecessary wait for test results and secondary consultation with the doctor. To achieve this, we will market our testing centres as an alternative to hospital laboratory testing. Say, a doctor has given a prescribed test to the patient, the hospital will inform the patient of testing centres available within their localities where they can go and do the tests and wait for the results at home. The testing centres will strictly be for sample taking and taking of vitals to avoid any queues. The patient will go to the testing centre right within their estate, give their sample to be tested, and leave to wait for the results via phone, which will also be sent to the doctor. In the event the test shows any ailment as suspected by the doctor, drugs will be prescribed which could be gotten at our partnered pharmacies or delivered right from the hospital. In the event that no ailment is found, drugs could also be offered to reduce symptoms or a different test prescribed. Either scenario would not matter in a hospital setting as the doctor would still prescribe drugs to either alleviate the symptoms or cure the ailment. Rarely do hospitals opt to admit a patient after a general consultation, which would be the only downside to not being within the hospital premises. This secondary consultation after a lab test is what takes up a huge chunk of time spent at hospitals, nearly one and a half hours. This could be replaced by a debrief after the test results are back, sent via text to explain what the results meant and to explain why the drugs were given. In total, excluding commuting time, the patient will have spent a combined total of 1 hour at the testing centre and the hospital.
<br></br>
While this offers convenience to both the hospital and the patient, the major deterrent to hospitals would be the fear of losing out on profits brought about by lab testing within their premises. In essence, we will be leasing our testing services to them. We will request a certain fee from the hospital on a monthly basis to gain access to all our testing centres. Let’s say there are 100 testing centres within Nairobi, including collaborating companies such as good life and lancet. The hospital will basically be paying to have access to all 100 testing centres. While this may seem even more discouraging profit-wise for them, there will be a catch. All money paid for testing by their patients will be channelled to them in full, or a large majority (90% or higher). When the hospital redirects their patient to one of our testing centres, the fee paid to do either of the tests as prescribed by the doctor will majorly belong to the hospital. Therefore, on top of reducing traffic within hospitals, we will not take any profit from them. They will, as a result, get all profits from consultation and all profits from lab testing. Medicine delivery from the hospitals will also enable them to get some of the profit from their in-hospital pharmacies. Medicine, however, isn’t as strong a negotiating point as most patients usually have the option of either buying the medicine at the hospital or getting it from a retailer outside the hospital. This usually depends on cost, and financial ability at the time. This basically reduces hospitals to consultancies, save for the few serious cases, and will reduce queues and congestion to a great extent.
<br></br>
This outlines how we will capture hospitals as the major stakeholders in our business without threatening any losses for them. It will be in the initial stages of implementation as we gain customers and more hospitals. The fee paid to us by the hospitals will be channelled to the owners of the remote testing centres, and a cut paid to us. Patients associated with the partnering hospitals will have access to all the testing centres. To sum it up, the hospital will be paying to have countless testing centres within its county, and for the management of their human traffic.
